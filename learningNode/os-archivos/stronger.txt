I don't do this for the riches
I'm infected, my condition is I'm always in my head
These words are my religion
I'm obsessive by decision
I'ma do this 'til I'm dead-ead
Set me on fire
Set me on, set me on fire
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm still alive
I'm still a, I'm still alive
Whoa-oh
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Fire, faster, everlasting (bet you didn't think I'd come back to life)
Higher, faster, never crashing
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
I do this with conviction
I write truths and never fiction
My disease is what you fed
I can't stopâ€¦
